            <p>Seven months with you and I still can’t believe how lucky I am to call you mine. You’re so much more than my girlfriend, you’re literally my everything. You’re my safe place, my light on the darkest days and the most incredible person I’ve ever met. Every moment with you feels like a blessing, whether we’re laughing until our cheeks hurt and we die of coughing (me) or even talking about nothing and just sitting in comfortable silence. And let me say darling....Your beauty? Goodness Gracious, where do I even start? It’s not just how beautiful you are (and trust me you are beyond perfect and beautiful) but it’s also in your smile that lights up a whole room and trust me I have witnessed that smile and almost got blinded every time by how much you light it up. The way your eyes sparkle when you’re happy or the sound of your laugh that makes everything feel right in the world, like world peace would be achieved if you laughed more fr darling. You’re so kind, smart, funny and you’re strong in ways that inspire me every single day and make me do better and want to actually BE better. I love how you care so deeply, how you put your heart into everything, and how you make everyone around you feel so special, especially me. You have this way of making even the smallest things feel magical and I can’t thank you enough for that nor even put into words how that makes me feel but I am trying my best. As the New Year gets closer sweetheart, I can’t stop thinking about everything we’ve already shared and how excited I am for everything that’s still ahead. More adventures and more memories and more love and honestly the best part of course, just more of you. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted and so much more than I ever thought I deserved darling ❤️ I love you more than words could ever say and I’m so grateful for every moment I get to spend with you. You’re not just my love, you’re my whole world and Universe and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Happy seven month Anniversary Sweetheart ❤️</p>
